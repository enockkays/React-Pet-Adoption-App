# React-Pet-Adoption-App
In this project we are working on a reactjs pet adoption web app. 
We shall first work with a fake API and then later integrate it to work with a real API from Petfinder which is dedicated to helping pets find homes.
1. Display adoptable pets in your web app.
2. Help users find their perfect pets by location, breed, and other characteristics.
